      <p class="subject"><strong>Subject:</strong> Application for the position of <em>Data Analyst</em></p>

      <p>Respected Sir/Madam,</p>

      <p>
        I am writing to express my keen interest in the position of <strong>Data Analyst</strong> at your esteemed
        organization. I am currently pursuing my <strong>Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)</strong> at
        <strong>IILM University, Greater Noida</strong> last year. Through my coursework and projects
        I have built a strong foundation in programming and data analytics, and I am eager to apply these skills to
        support data-driven decision-making within your team.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical skills includes <strong>Python and it's libraries(numpy,pandas)</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>,
        <strong>Excel</strong>, <strong>Quadratichq AI</strong>, <strong>Power BI</strong> for data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and basic
        modeling. I also practice <strong>Tableau</strong> for interactive dashboards and have beginner knowledge of
        <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>DBMS</strong> concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I actively upskill through short courses and certifications, including <strong>SQL (DataFlair)</strong>,
        <strong>DBMS (Great Learning)</strong>, <strong>Retail (Infosys)</strong>, <strong>Networking Basics (Cisco)</strong>,
        and <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>. These complement my academic work and have strengthened my problem-solving,
        communication, and analytical mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I am disciplined and growth-oriented. I maintain a balanced routine focused on learning, fitness, and
        consistency. While backend engineering is an area I am still strengthening, I bring curiosity, fast learning, and
        careful attention to detail â€” qualities I am confident will help me contribute value from day one.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm align with your teamâ€™s goals. Thank you for
        considering my application.
      </p>

      <p class="closing">
        Sincerely,<br />
